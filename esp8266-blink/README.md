# ESP8266 Blink

This repo contains sample code to test an ESP8266 by blinking its built-in LED.

The difference between this and the default Arduino blink sample is that here it's possible to enable serial to log execution steps of blinking, which allows you to follow up what's going on inside the algorithm through the serial port, mainly for the cases when built-in LED does not work.
